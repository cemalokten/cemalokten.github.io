                Hi my name is Cemal, I am a web developer in the making. Once upon a time I worked in the
                design industry, designing <span>furniture</span> and <span>products</span>.

                Lately, I've been learning how to create things with lines of code instead of pieces of wood.

            <p>Some projects I have recently worked on include a keyboard <span>glockenspiel</span>, a
                <span>clock</span> that shows time in bars, a page which shows if the <span>ISS</span>
                is orbiting over land or sea and a site for an imaginary agency called <span>kindCode</span>.

            <p>Plus a page
                which randomly
                generates square <span>paintings</span>, and a site which uses the NASA <span>Mars Rover</span> API and
                a <span>font</span> changer thing.</p>
